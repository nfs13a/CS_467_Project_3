This program requires Java 7 or 8 (I used 8, but it should be backwards compatible).

Compile the program with "javac NoughtsAndCrosses.java" or "javac callMyBluff.java"

Run the program with "java NoughtsAndCrosses" or "java callMyBluff"

Make sure that the java compiler and interpreter are is in the path.

I programmed and tested in Eclipse Neon (4.6.0), so I am not anticipating any issues to arise on command line or otherwise.

Input: you will be prompted for a character designating which type of game you want to play. Follow the on-screen instructions.
