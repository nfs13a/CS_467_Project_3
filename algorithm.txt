read states from csv's, store in maps

class for player, subclasses for crosses and noughts

loop until game is over, keep and flip bool to determine whose turn it is

	at new turn, number of possible moves should be equal to number of empty spaces in the string

		if state does not exist, create it in map, assign value of .5

		consider every possible state

		store every move (chosen new state) in an array in the c/n object

at end, allow outcome to propogate through arrays of chosen moves, then overwrite maps values with these values

at end, write maps to csv's
